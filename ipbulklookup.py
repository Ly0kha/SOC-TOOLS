#Name:          IP Bulk Lookup Tool   
#Description: This script accepts a text file full of IP's (1 per line) and cross references them against a number of live open source lists
# I often find myself in need of a bulk lookup to see if there are blacklist hits in a large IP list (firewall log? access log?). 
# I'll be adding new sources to this as time allows.
#License:        Free as in Free Beer. Please use, abuse and improve :)
#Author:        Andrew Swartwood

# NOTES: This has been tested on OSX with Python 2.7.5 and Kali Linux with Python 2.7.3. Make sure the text file input contains only one IP per line.
