SOC-TOOLS
=========

This repo is for quick and dirty security analyst tools that I create as needed, hopefully they prove useful! :)

ipbulklookup.py - This script takes a list of IP's as input and runs them against a number of open source indicator lists. This is intended as a quick test during an investigation (example: dump the DNS cache or logs from a system under investigation and run this right from your analysis box).

dnsres.py - This is a simple script to do bulk DNS resolution and reverse lookups.
